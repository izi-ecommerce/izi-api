  * #119 Default add ``upc`` to the ``ProductSerializer``

-------------------
Fixes:
  * Shipping address is not required during checkout

Features:
  * Tested with Oscar 1.5.1, updated dependencies

-------------------
Fixes:
  * #105 `ProductPrice` and `ProductAvailability` views resuled in server error if the matching product is not found (taaviteska)

1.1.4 (2017-07-04)
-------------------
Features:
  * #102 Let the `ProductAttribute` and `ProductAttributeValue` serializer fields be overridable in the settings (yazanhorani)
  * #101 Don't delete anonymous basket which are merged after login, leave them in the database with the status ``MERGED`` (aleksandrpanteleymonov)

Notes:
  Before this release, anonymous baskets where merged in the ``LoginView`` and after being merged, deleted. This behaviour is now removed, so anonymous baskets remain in the database and have the status ``MERGED`` (This is more in the direction of how Oscar is working). You can change this behaviour by overriding the ``merge_baskets`` method / hook in the ``LoginView``, or you should add a cron job to cleanup old baskets with the status ``MERGED`` from the database.
